# Weather Forecast
A simple weather forecasting web-based application made with React JS.

## How To Run
* Through your terminal you can clone the repository using the **git clone** command. Once cloned, simply go inside it and issue the **npm install** command. Once done you can issue the **npm start** command which if susccessful you would then be able to view the app on the browser by typing **localhost:3000** on the address bar.
* You can also download the build folder in the **build branch** and you can then run it on your own web server.

## API Used
For this project I used OpenMeteo for the weather api, and for the forward geocoding I used GeocodeMaps.
